## Methodologies
Utilizing a small-team structure, group members established guidelines for splitting up development tasks and saving work to a
shared repository.  Establishing guidelines prior to the project helped to minimize merge conflicts.  Over the course of approximately 8 days, features were incrementally saved to the repository.  Each feature was tested and often refactored before being marked as completed in a Trello board.  Completing one feature at a time kept the team on track to complete the minimum viable product and to keep from stretching the team too thin over too many features.  

Features were chosen based on the availability of time and the feasibility to complete the features in the given time.  Stretch goals were then implemented as time allowed.  Tests were developed and used throughout to ensure features functioned as planned.
